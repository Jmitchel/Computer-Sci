        <center><p>Vindinium is a game where players program AI
        called bots to collect mines, heal, and fight the bots that other players have
        created. To play this game you write code in JavaScript that tells your Bot to
        do different things depending on it's surroundings. After you finish with your code
        you enter your Bot into the Arena where it plays against other players Bots. In 
        order for your Bot to win it must have the most gold at the end of the game. To
        obtain gold your Bot must capture mines, mines generate one gold per mine per turn,
        and protect them(the mines) from other players Bots.</p></center>

        <center><p>Starting here is where the code starts to be more interesting. This code
        tells my bot to go to a tavern to heal when it's health is less than fifty, if
        it's health is above fifty then it is told to claim unoccupied mines if there
        are more than zero unoccupied mines. If all the mines are occupied by other players
        then my Bot will attack the nearest enemy with less health then my bot, if all enemies
        have more health than my Bot it's direction will be set to "none". this means
        that the computer will randomly select a direction until a enemy has less health than
        my Bot or my Bot has less than fifty health. I made my bot do this to keep it
        from crashing.</p></center>

        <center><p>This code could be considered the most important code that my Bot has,
        this code is what tells your bot how to do stuff like capture mines and attack enemies.
        First, we have the code that has you go to taverns, I will now explain how it
        all works. First, the computer is told that if the curent task is "taverns"
        to pull up where all the taverns are in the arena that they are currently in.
        After that there is a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp">for loop</a>
        that keeps running the distance between all the taverns and where they are and
        compare them to my Bots location to calculate which tavern is the closest. After
        that it sets my Bot in the direction of whatever tavern is the closest to it.
        The next piece of code that we have tells my Bot how to attack enemies. First,
        we tell the computer that if the task is "attackenemies" to run the for loop that
        calulates which enemy is the closest by comparing the position of all of the
        enemies to the current position of my Bot. After it claculates which enemy is the
        closest it sends my Bot in the direction of that enemy and console logs that it is
        going to attack an enemy. Finally, we have the code that tells the bot to go
        in a random direction if it has no direction. First, we tell the computer that if
        my Bot has no set direction to console log "Going Random!" and then select a random
        direction. After it randomly selects a direction it sets my Bots direction to that
        direction.</p></center>
        <center><h2>What I Learned About AI(Artificial Intelligence)</h2></center>
        <center><p>The thing about AI is that it thinks on it's own and you can't control it.
        This sometimes leads to it making stupid decisions that will make you want to bang
        your head against the table. When you build a bot it may seem really difficult at first,
        but when you finally figure it out it will seem simple and you will help you learn how to
        think more like a programer. Before this project when I thought of AI I thought of
        robots that think like humans do, but now I know that AI can be much simpler than
        that.</p></center>
