  <center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>
  <font size=5><p> This website is a project for a class I have
  been taking in school. In this website I will tell you
  a little bit about myself, you can find this in the About Me
  section that you can reach through the menu bar. After you read through
  that head over to About HTML where I will go over what HTML and CSS
  are and some of their simpler functions.</p></font>
  <center><h2>Class Introduction</h2></center>
  <font size=5><p>In this paragraph I will go over the basics of
  what I do in this class. During our first two week long course
  we are being tought HTML and CSS which is used to create and add 
  color/special effects to websites, once we finish this two week
  session we will have around three months before we return to
  this class. Once we start again we will be getting into more
  complicated subjects(compared to HTML and CSS) such as
  coding with Javascript and working with Arduinos.</p></font>
