  <center><h1>Hello & Welcome To My Website</h1></center><br>
  <center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>
  <font size=5><p> This website is a project for a class I have
  been taking in school. In this website I will tell you
  a little bit about myself, you can find this in the About Me
  section that you can reach through the menu bar. After you read through
  that head over to About HTML where I will go over what HTML and CSS
  are and some of their simpler functions.</p></font>
  <center><h2>Class Introduction</h2></center>
  <font size=5><p>In this paragraph I will go over the basics of
  what I do in this class. During our first two week long course
  we are being tought HTML and CSS which is used to create and add 
  color/special effects to websites, once we finish this two week
  session we will have around three months before we return to
  this class. Once we start again we will be getting into more
  complicated subjects(compared to HTML and CSS) such as
  coding with Javascript and working with Arduinos.</p></font>
  <center><h2>Class Purpose</h2></center>
  <p><font size=5>In this paragraph I will be answering a few questions
  about the purpose of the class I am currently taking. There are
  multiple different reasons why we are taking this class that can
  vary from all the other classes being boring to the person likes
  coding and HTML, however the main goal of this class is to teach
  students the basics of computer science, a very important skill
  to have in our ever expanding society. In this class our teacher
  will be teaching us stuff like Javascript, HTML & CSS and at one
  point we will even be working with Arduino robots. Finally, at
  the end of this class we will have a basic knowledge of computer
  science and what we can manipulate it to do.</font></p>
  <h2><center>Content Overview</center></h2>
  <p><font size=5>This website will have quite a bit of information
  so I will give you a brief overview of what page contains what
  information so that you don't waste your precious time because until
  someone invents time travel you have no way of geting that time
  back. First I'll go over the "About Me" page. In the "About Me"
  page I go over who I am a little bit, but only the basics that won't
  give away any major personal information. If you want to learn
  about what HTML is and some basic HTML comands go to the "About HTML" page.
  Finally, if you want to learn about hardware go to the "About Hardware"
  page and it will tell you some of the basics about hardware like what
  is a motherboard and how they help a computer to function.
